**Description**

GreenQuest is a mobile application designed to address the critical need for effective environmental education, particularly for children. Recognizing that traditional learning methods often fall short in engaging young audiences, GreenQuest leverages the power of mobile technology and gamification to make learning about waste management and recycling fun and interactive. 

Inspired by research from Stanford University, which found a strong correlation between early environmental education and the development of sustainable habits in adulthood, GreenQuest aims to instill a lifelong love for the environment in children. By combining engaging educational content, interactive features like image recognition, and a motivating reward system with global leaderboards, we aim to empower the next generation to make informed choices and contribute to a cleaner, greener future.
